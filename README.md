Problem Statement: Travel.Com aims to grow its customer base by introducing new package offerings, including a Wellness Tourism Package 
focused on promoting healthy lifestyles. Currently, 18% of customers purchase their existing packages (Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super
Deluxe, and King). However, last year's random marketing efforts led to high costs. To improve cost-effectiveness, the company plans to
use customer data to optimize its marketing strategies for the new Wellness package.


In this project I used various methods to clean the data. I used OneHotEncoding to convert categorical data into numerical data. To train
and test the data i used Random Forest Algorithm. For evaluation purpose we used Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC curve 
and Graph. In case of hyperparameter I used Random Search Cross Validation Technique.
